<h2>applying to college</h2> 

<p>It's about that time of year where many high school seniors are applying to colleges, so I figured now would be a good time to write this up.</p> 

<p>1. Figure out which colleges you want to apply to. If you are unsure, consider different factors such as major, location, and class sizes. 
    There's more than just these three, so I would definitely suggest researching on your own. It's generally a good idea to choose a mix of safeties, targets, and reach schools. 
    No matter how good your high school stats are, the college admissions process does not always work in your favor. 
    You certainly don't want to find yourself rejected from all the schools you applied to because you chose not to apply to any safeties. 
    In addition, don't let the cost of college hold you back from applying. Many colleges, particularly privates, are often willing to give 
    financial aid, scholarships, and/or grants if you do manage to get it. If you are applying to a lot of colleges, the cost of application fees 
    can increase exponentially, so it's a good idea to check with your high school's administrators to see if you can retrieve any fee waivers 
    to lower these costs. Ultimately, if you are unsure whether or not to apply to a college, just apply. You don't lose anything by trying. 
    Who knows? You might even get in! :)</p>

<p>2. Apply for financial aid. If you're in the United States, complete FAFSA early to ensure financial aid priority. Know that 
    the financial aid process may vary from country to country. You may want to ask one of your high school counselors for more information 
    about it.</p> 

<p>3. Start applications early. This not only goes for college applications, but also for scholarships as well. This will give you enough 
    time to write and revise your essays and will give your teachers and counselors enough time to write high quality letters of recommendation.</p> 

<p>4. Continue to perform well in your classes. If you are taking a lot of advanced courses during your final year, now is not the time to 
    have senioritis. Depending on your major and the current courses you are taking, these classes may be important stepping stones as you 
    transition from high school to college. Absorb as much knowledge as you can now to prepare yourself for the future. In addition, if your 
    grades slip too much, there is a possibility that your acceptance may be rescinded, so keep that in mind.</p> 

<p>5. Enjoy your final year in high school. This one's pretty self explanatory. Don't forget to hang out with friends and attend fun school events. You only 
    live once, bro.</p>
