<h2>is college worth it?</h2> 

<p>I just finished my first year of university, so I've have a lot of time to reflect on this question. Both of my parents attended college, so I was expected to go, too. I often talked to my parents about education, college, and career. I am very fortunate that my parents are willing to pay for my college, and I applaud those who are willing to pay for their child's college because it's an investment into their career and future.</p>
